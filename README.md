important:

- this specific system assumes 1-9 indexes are hotbinds for the inventory (like in roblox or minecraft when you press 1-9, you get the item that it's binded to)
- very next item is automatically added to the backpack (10 and greater index) and this can be changed within the code easily by doing few changes

features:

- get next placeable index in backpack
- replace items
- clean and reorder the backpack

(Influenced by ROBLOX's backpack behaviour with the tweak of new items being bind to 10 and greater indexes)
